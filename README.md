# Lending Club Case Study
> The project is about assessing the credit risk of borrowers. The objective is to identify the driving factor that will help to quantify the credit risk of
borrowers and hence help to predict the probability of borrowers defaulting. 


## General Information
The project deal with Lending Club loan dataset. Lending Club  is the largest online loan marketplace providing loan with low interest rate. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. Hence to reduce the amount of credit loss, it is vital to identify these risky loan applicants. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
